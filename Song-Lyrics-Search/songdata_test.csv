Adele,All I Ask,"[Verse 1]  
I will leave my heart at the door  
I won't say a word  
They've all been said before, you know  
So why don't we just play pretend  
Like we're not scared of what's coming next  
Or scared of having nothing left  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Look, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I don't need your honesty  
It's already in your eyes and I'm sure my eyes, they speak for me  
No one knows me like you do  
And since you're the only one that matters, tell me who do I run to?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now, don't get me wrong  
I know there is no tomorrow  
All I ask is  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?  
  
[Bridge]  
Let this be our lesson in love  
Let this be the way we remember us  
I don't wanna be cruel or vicious  
And I ain't asking for forgiveness  
All I ask is...  
  
[Chorus]  
If this is my last night with you  
Hold me like I'm more than just a friend  
Give me a memory I can use  
Take me by the hand while we do what lovers do  
It matters how this ends  
Cause what if I never love again?"
Adele,Can't Let Go,"[Verse 1]  
When did it go wrong, I will never know  
I have loved you all my life  
How did it slow down, I go round and round  
Thinking about it all the time  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
This love, it ain't over yet  
There's too much that I haven't said  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why were you so cold, let the truth be told  
Tell me was it all for the thrill?  
What was I thinking, I gave you everything  
But you still went for the kill  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I gave you heaven on a platter baby  
I gave you everything you never gave me  
I never lied and I never faked it  
Only wanted for you to save me  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write with a lump in my throat  
Do you even know I can't let go  
  
[Bridge]  
Oooh sometimes I feel like I'm in the dark  
Oooh I thought I'd die in your arms  
  
[Chorus]  
Did you find the note that I wrote?  
I hid it in the seam of your coat  
It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat  
Do you even know that I can't let go  
  
[Outro]  
Hope you know, I won't let go"
Bob Dylan,4Th Time Around,"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

Bob Dylan,A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.
